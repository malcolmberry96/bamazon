# bamazon

**##Project Overview**

###Bamazon is a node based applicatation that I created in week 12 of the UT Austin Coding BootCamp. This application uses javascript and a MySQL database in order to generate functionalities that include allowing "customers" to view items, check their availablility, and purchase them. 

**##What the JS Command line does**

1. User types in node bamazonCustomer.js into the bamazon directory 
2. Program prompts a welcome message and a list of items available for purchase
3. Program prompts the user via npm inquirer and selects options via the items ID number 
4. User selects quantity and program checks the availablity. If available, the program will continue with the order and if not will generate a response of "Sorry, we're out of stock". 
5. Program will process the order and tell the user their total and ask if they would like to make any more purchases. If the user selects yes, the program will rerun. If user selects no, the program will give the response "Thank you, see you again!".
